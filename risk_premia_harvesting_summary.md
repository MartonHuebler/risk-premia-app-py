# Risk Premia Harvesting: A simple srategic approach to long-term wealth building

## The Core Premise

Risk Premia Harvesting represents a reliable, high-probability investment edge that requires minimal skill to exploit effectively. The strategy centers on a fundamental market principle: investors receive compensation - in the form of excess returns - for deliberately exposing themselves to certain long-term risks that others find distasteful. This compensation is the "risk premium," and harvesting these premia systematically forms the foundation of a robust investment approach.

## Understanding Risk Premia

At its essence, the concept of risk premia stems from a straightforward observation: assets whose cash flows are sensitive to specific risks trade at relatively lower prices than assets with more certain cash flows. This underpricing translates directly into higher expected returns for investors willing to bear these risks.

**Bond Risk Premia**

US Treasury Bonds exemplify this principle clearly. These instruments pay fixed coupon payments, but their attractiveness diminishes when interest rates rise, as newly issued bonds offer higher yields. A bond yielding 2% becomes significantly less appealing when 5% yields become available. Consequently, existing bonds must decrease in value to offer competitive yields, creating capital losses for bondholders. Similarly, inflation erodes the real value of fixed dollar payments, presenting another risk dimension. These inherent risks—interest rate sensitivity and inflation vulnerability—cause bonds to trade at lower prices than they would if their cash flows were guaranteed, resulting in higher yields for investors willing to accept these risks.

**Equity Risk Premia**

Equities carry all the risks associated with bonds, plus additional layers of uncertainty. Equity values depend on corporate profits and distributions to shareholders, which face numerous threats: rising interest rates, inflation, slowing economic growth, political instability, and liquidity concerns during market panics. The 2008 Great Financial Crisis exemplified these risks dramatically, with stocks experiencing a 50% drawdown.

Yet despite - or rather, because of - these risks, equities have delivered extraordinary long-term returns. Historical data from 1900 onwards shows US stocks increasing nearly 50,000 times in value, while bonds have appreciated roughly 500 times. This dramatic outperformance exists precisely because investors demand compensation for enduring periods of significant volatility and drawdown.

**Gold as a tail risk hedge**
Gold is often sold to investors as an inflation hedge, but has often done pretty well in low growth/deflation periods and in particular periods characterised by uncertainty and geopolitical risk - the COVID crisis, the recent resurgence of tarrifs. It is not an asset with an obvious risk premium, but it is an asset that is uncorrelated or even negatively correlated to financial assets in certain extreme economic conditions; very helpful to diversify a portfolio. 

## The Investment Rationale

The fundamental lesson is elegantly simple: stocks and bonds tend to go up over sufficiently long time horizons. The mechanism driving this appreciation is the risk premium - the excess return investors receive for accepting uncertainty. This creates a counterintuitive but powerful investment principle: intentionally seeking exposure to certain risks leads to superior long-term returns.

The strategy involves pursuing risks that offer compensation while minimizing unrewarded risks. Concentration risk and unnecessary volatility don't generate premiums, so these should be managed through diversification. The goal is straightforward: maximize exposure to compensated risks while using diversification to reduce overall portfolio volatility.

## The Strategy Implementation

The Risk Premia Harvesting demo uses three core assets, each capturing different risk exposures across various economic environments:

**VTI (US Stock Market ETF)**: Provides broad exposure to equity risk premia, including sensitivity to economic growth, inflation, interest rates, and liquidity conditions.

**TLT (20+ Year Treasury Bonds ETF)**: Captures bond risk premia, particularly exposure to real interest rates and inflation risks. Bonds typically perform well in deflationary, low-growth environments.

**GLD (Gold ETF)**: While gold generates no cash flows, it serves as a crucial diversifier, performing well in economic conditions that challenge the other two assets. Gold provides uncorrelated returns and acts as a hedge during uncertain periods.

This three-asset portfolio provides reasonable coverage across all possible economic regimes—whether experiencing high or low inflation, strong or weak growth. By maintaining constant exposure to all three assets and dynamically managing volatility to equalize it across assets and time, the strategy remains perpetually positioned to harvest available risk premia without attempting to time market conditions.

## Why This Edge Persists

Risk Premia Harvesting qualifies as a high-probability "edge" that continues to reward investors with excess  performance when adjusted for risk-reward ratios, for several compelling reasons:

**Economic Function**: Holding risk assets serves a genuine purpose in the financial system. Investors willing to bear risks that others avoid create a win-win dynamic—some gain excess returns while others achieve preferred risk profiles.

**Definitional Stability**: The strategy explicitly seeks risk exposure, which is fundamental to its function. This isn't an arbitrage that disappears once discovered; it's a structural feature of markets where risk-averse participants will always demand compensation for bearing uncertainty.

**Robust Evidence**: Risk premia represent perhaps the most empirically validated effects in finance, with extensive evidence spanning centuries, multiple asset classes, and diverse market conditions.

**Behavioral Persistence**: Human psychology ensures that many investors will always struggle to maintain exposure during volatile periods, perpetuating the compensation available to those who can.

## Conclusion

Risk Premia Harvesting offers a systematic approach to wealth building grounded in fundamental market principles rather than forecasting ability or complex timing mechanisms. By maintaining disciplined exposure to compensated risks through a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, and gold, while managing volatility dynamically, investors can harness one of finance's most reliable edges. Success depends not on sophisticated adjustments or market timing, but simply on showing up consistently and maintaining exposure through inevitable periods of discomfort—remembering that the premium exists precisely because of that discomfort.
